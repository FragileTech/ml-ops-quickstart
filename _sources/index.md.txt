ML Ops Quickstart is a tool for initializing Machine Learning projects following ML Ops best practices.

Setting up new repositories is a time-consuming task that involves creating different files and 
configuring tools such as linters, docker containers and continuous integration pipelines. 
The goal of `mloq` is to simplify that process, so you can start writing code as fast as possible.

`mloq` generates customized templates for Python projects with focus on Maching Learning. An example of 
the generated templates can be found in [mloq-template](https://github.com/FragileTech/mloq-template).
